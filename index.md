### The Internet in Nodes

When simply navigating the Internet it is not always clear how interconnected the websites and pages that call the net home are. Originally drawn on a napkin for the US military, the ARPANet that would become the Internet was planned out 8 nodes. These nodes were easily represented on a graph, and paths from one node to another were easy to see. The modern internet had millions of nodes making up the backbone alone. A graphical representation of such a medium is nearly indecipherable for the human, and functions best simply as a proof of the sheer scale of the system.

This site seeks to explore the ways in which the modern Internet is more useful as complex connection of media than a medium in it of itself. In terms of meta-analysis, the Internet is a particularly interesting medium being one of the most technical and wide reaching of modernly used media. However, the different ways in which "text" can be portrayed with computer technology and hosted on the Internet add new and important layers with which to view said medium.

### The Wikipedia Philosophy Phenomenon 

A unique phenomenon exists on Wikipedia in which 97% (as of February 2016) of articles eventually link to the article on Philosophy by following the first **non-italicized, non-parenthesized** existing link to another article. Almost all articles on Wikipedia are connected to others through links on the page. The articles can be represented as nodes on a graph, just as pages / sites on the Internet are. In doing so, one can see the various paths, connections, and unexpected relations that these topics have.
A third party site, [Xefer](https://xefer.com/wikipedia), draws out this graph with the given articles.
