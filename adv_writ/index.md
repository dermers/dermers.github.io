## As a Writer

I've found that, throughout the semester, I have developed my skills primarily with respect to adapting my writing to the context it is around. When I wrote for previous courses (and in highschool) I often adopted a similiar tone and format, merely aiming to get my point across. I had yet to realize that the best way to achieve such a goal was to consciously adapt my writing based on the audience and type of writing it is. 

When we began the semester, I viewed most writing as simply that: the written word. I had yet to consider the methods with which writing can be a tool adapted for the sake of sharing ideas effectively. In the very first exercise, when we told any story that came to mind, I chose to write about when I hid *too well* during a preschool event because "this prompt reminded me of \[an\]... assignment from last semester and thus the story itself". I wrote about the first thing that came to mind because it would be easy. While I did want to allow "my fellow classmates to better get to know me", I was primarilly striving to satisfy the prompt first. 

Our discussion after served as a learning experience for me (the first of many) as my fellow classmates shared their stories and reasons for writing about them. Many used the chance to share as an opportunity to introduce themselves to thee class in a more personal and connected way. They saw the potential of the exercise and shared family stories and anecdotes as well as scenes from their favorite media. In doing so, we learned about who they are, what drives them, and where they came from. I've since come to slightly regret not doing the same. While I think my preschool misadventures can be quite entertaining, I would have liked to share something more meaningful in hindisght as the exercise was the perfect medium to do so. 

Upon realizing the aforementioned missed opportunities and how much I've grown as a writer over the semester, I decided to run "sentiment analysis" on my writing notebook. Sentiment analysis is a statistical measure that judges text as positive, negative, or neutral with ratios given to each category. The analysis focuses on the connotation of words and phrases while ignoring "stop words" (words that are effectively meaningless for natural language processing but commonly used such as "an", "the", and "a").

I tackled this goal with Python, a realtively readable programming language that can be convenient when writing simple scripts. I had it read in a text file (my writing notebook, downloaded directly from drive) and remove some unfirendly characters like 'œ' then made an API (application programming interface) request to a public library with the string of text. The API returned an overall label for my writing as well as the percentage values for each of the three labels. 

It turns out that my notebook had an overall negative sentiment associated with it (about 52% versus the 48% positive score). While this did come as a slight suprise given the lighthearted exercises we did in class, I think the generally serious topics I covered tipped the analysis over the edge. The minimal neutral score was also a small shock. I figured the academic tone I attempted to portrary in my writing would increase this number, but perhaps my "voice" was still able to come through more than expected.

For the first project, I was able to immiediately consider the audience as well as what I hoped to achieve in my writing. I knew that my rhetorical analysis would serve as an introduction to Computer Science and cryptocurrency concepts for many. With this in mind I set to explain the field from my perspective, describing it as "primarily concerned with solving the problem of solving problems". At the end of the day, computers are tools. We are not studying the tool itself, but how to use the tool. 

Throughout the analysis of the article itself, I strove to be as clear as possible. The topic of the piece may have been unique and even confusing for readers, but Qamar employed classic rhetorical devices that I could focus on. I went through the article chronologically, analysing the paragprahs and sections in the same order a reader would experience them and explained why Qamar did what he did. Qamar would often set up "why" or "how" questions in the readers minds that he would proceed to answer, and I made sure to emphasize this. He often had "perfect segue\[s\]" that I hoped to parrellel in my writing. In doing so, I was able to consider both the reader and form of my project, adapting and adjusting to best convey my message. 

For project 2, I also had to adapt my writing to a reader that was realtively unfamiliar with the concepts being discussed. Here, my group discussed the research around the use of chat-bots as therapists. We took an academic approach, knowing that the sources we cited were peer reviewed studies. In doing so, we went through multiple drafts in which we took out "fluff" that, while it did add to the overall context of the piece, meant little in terms of the evidence we were summarizing. For example, I went from explaining "Tay", Microsoft's Twitter bot, and how she works to simply focusing on the problem she revealed: "unguided learning can lead to unpredicted results". This was the important part of the work cited, and I made sure to emphasize it in our final draft. 

By the end of the semester, I had grown significantly as a writer, to the point where I felt confident that I could make the right decisions based on the right considerations to truly get my point across. I realized when writing for one of the last exercises just how much this was true. In a way, it wrapped everything that's been slowly building into one clean revalation. As I wrote different explanations for the same event, I was able to maintain my voice (significantly so) while also changing what I wrote entirely to adapt to the audience and purpose of the piece. With friends, I offered a casual "welp" as I would in conversation, whereas with parents I emphasized that "everyone's ok" as I knew that would be the first thing they asked.

This class made me a better writer. Not because I learned to satisfy certain requirements or use new sentence structures, but because I learned *how* to be a writer. Language is a tool that I had underestimated before, but I have since developed my abilities to the point where I feel confident expressing myself in all sorts of contexts with the written word. I am prepared to adapt my writing, while maintaing my voice, in the real world.

### Sentiment Analysis

I downloaded my writing notebook as a text file and ran it through sentiment analysis using the following code I wrote in Python:

> import requests
>  
> file = open('notebook.txt', 'r', errors='ignore')  
> data = file.read().replace('\n', ' ').replace('â€', '').replace('œ', '').replace('™', '\'').replace('“', '')  
> file.close()  
> result = requests.post("http://text-processing.com/api/sentiment/", "text="+data).json()  
> print('Label: ' + result.get('label'))  
> print('Stats: ' + str(result.get('probability')))

The results were as follows:

> Label: neg  
> Stats: {'neg': 0.5218397698752539, 'neutral': 0.15954812138732322, 'pos': 0.478160230124746}

I was suprised to find that my writing leaned slightly negative, especially with some of the light hearted exercises we did in class.
This may, however, be attributed to the more serious topics I chose to cover with my larger pieces.  
I was also suprised at how little neutrality was found in my writing as I tried to keep a professional, academic tone for my projects.

### Project 1 - Revised

  Computer Science is a modern, <mark>technical field</mark> focused on the use, abilities, and theory behind computational devices and processes. The field has been used to tackle issues ranging from basic calculations, to sending data simultaneously around the globe, to intelligent and flexible robots. While Computer Science is widely regarded as a relatively new, up-and-coming realm of study, the principles behind it have been around almost as long as other traditional sciences <mark>and</mark> mathematics. The abacus for example, was (albeit primitive) technically a computer. Algorithms for encrypting data have been around since Julius Ceasar when the aptly names Ceasar Cipher was used to keep military messages secret if the courier was captured. In fact, in the early 1800s Ada Lovelace wrote what is considered to be the first computer program (thus making her the first computer programmer) to run on a machine invented by Charles Babbage (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2019).
	
  In Computer Science, there is unique value in problem solving. Computers are great at following instructions, but just that. If one does not know how to talk to a Computer, one will not truly be able to use a computer. Problems need to be broken down both to their individual pieces and the steps needed to solve them. In doing so, computer scientists are also concerned with efficiency. Even with a correct set of steps to solve a problem, the algorithm may be useless if it cannot be solved in large <mark>or</mark> real cases in a reasonable amount of time. Some algorithms can even take longer than the inevitable heat death of the universe if given only a few thousand pieces of information to analyze (Bendanan, 2016). The more operations a computer must perform, the slower it takes (computers can only do a limited number of things at a time), so if an algorithm requires exponentially more operations per piece of input, it will take effectively forever. Because of this, Computer Science is, to put it simply, primarily concerned with solving the problem of solving problems quickly and correctly. 
	
  The writing within this field often varies widely in target audience, ranging anywhere from the casual consumer to the tech-savvy professor. Often times, Computer Scientists tend to shift their genre and style greatly to adapt to said audience groups based on their goals. When arguing for widespread adoption of a new technology, for example, it is important to appeal to a common member of the public. On the other hand, when introducing a new set of algorithms / technology and proving its effectiveness, it is important to get to the “meat” of the argument, sacrificing background information in exchange for brevity and keeping the reader’s attention. To see some of this in action, one can look at a “whitepaper” for new technologies, especially cryptocurrencies, a simple op-ed on CNN’s tech section, or even a blog post from a well-versed tech enthusiast like the piece I will be analyzing. 
	
  I have been studying Computer Science since high school but have learned most of what I know in the two years I have been at Northeastern. I am majoring in Computer Science here and have also taken an interest in Cyber Security classes <mark>and</mark> topics. As such, I am primarily concerned with solving the subset of the aforementioned problems pertaining to privacy and security issues. Data privacy has been all over the news recently, and with the increased use of both traditional computers as well as “Internet of Things” devices such as the Amazon Alexa, it is becoming more and more important that the technology we use is founded on secure and safe practices, lest our personal information become free reign for corporations, criminals, and even our friends to use against us. Many computer scientists take to the Internet to share their ideas and proposals in regard to these issues, and I have enjoyed reading a wide range of perspectives on the topic. 
	
  Last year, Bitcoin was all the rage, rising in traded value at unprecedented rates to an all time high of almost twenty thousand dollars. Getting involved just after Bitcoin buzz calmed down again, Ali Qamar attempted to convince the average crypto user to switch over from Bitcoin to Monero (Qamar, 2018). In a blog post on a tech site, Qamar was able to assume basic knowledge of cryptocurrency: most users were familiar with at least what it was, and of those, his target audience was likely already a fan of Bitcoin. Qamar is not inexperienced in his topic of choice either, having built a career around both privacy and cryptocurrency. 
	
  Qamar starts his piece, first and foremost, by enthusiastically introducing Monero. He sets the tone for the rest of his article, explaining how Monero is a relatively new coin still climbing at the same rate of Bitcoin but with additional features worth taking a look at. His excitement is contagious <mark>as his tone ramps up</mark> and encourages the viewers to read on. They are set up to carry the momentum into the bulk of his argument. Right away, Qamar hits a key point, following up from his introduction in speed by comparing Monero directly to Bitcoin. Monero, he explains, enforces untraceable transactions between users, as opposed to Bitcoin’s, which are only anonymous (Qamar, 2018). 
	
  At this point, the reader is left wondering “why” and “how” Monero is able to pull this off? After all, these are still financial transactions, and Bitcoin is still considered revolutionary despite lacking in these features. Qamar knows this and does not hesitate to clarify: Monero uses what is referred to as ring signatures to scramble the “addresses” involved in each transaction (Qamar, 2018). This means that a user’s address is harder to discern, and even if it is discovered, can’t be tracked. No information on the user’s behavior with Monero can slip through the cracks. Now that Qamar has established the credibility of his first point (Monero offers more privacy by simply hiding more information about its users), he steps up a concession – and refutation – of the most likely counter-argument. Monero may have some advantages, but Bitcoin is the most popular (and valuable) coin for a reason. Qamar admits this, Bitcoin established the entire market and Monero likely wouldn’t exist without it; however, he also argues that the primary reason for Bitcoin being able to maintain that popularity is not from quality but from ignorance (Qamar, 2018). Most people simply do not know much about alternative coins if at all.
  
  Qamar positioned himself well here. He knows that the reader is likely coming down off the original excitement he conveyed and acted to perk them back up. By focusing on ignorance as the primary reason to prefer Bitcoin over Monero, he re-captures his readers’ attention. They themselves are most likely biased towards Bitcoin and may even use it themselves. What is it that Qamar knows that they don’t? He uses this opportunity to jump into a list of reasons to prefer Monero. These are more concrete than those he’s mentioned before and are listed <mark>back-to-back</mark>, upping the pace. In doing so, he sets up the viewer to both absorb the reasons they are reading and to feel compelled to keep reading. 
  
  Qamar begins this list simply, re-emphasizing the security <mark>and</mark> privacy advantages of Monero. In doing so, the reader has a chance to keep up with the increased pace dragging them in. There’s no risk of information overload, despite getting right to the point. Qamar also elaborates on the non-privacy benefits of Monero’s privacy features: value. Although uncited, Qamar appeals to authority, claiming that sources show Monero is bound to raise in price even more than it already has as word of its existence spreads (Qamar, 2018). 
  
  The mention of value also provides a perfect segue into Qamar’s next point. <mark>While</mark> this part of his article is series of short and <mark>to-the-point</mark> paragraphs, smooth transitions prevent a jarring tone and keep the reader from being taken out of the moment. Qamar has been tantalizing the reader with potential financial gains, and here he makes good on those hints, claiming Monero is projected to reach $1000 or more (Qamar, 2018). Although this is also uncited, the excitement this puts in the reader’s mind is undeniable, especially for crypto enthusiasts riding the high of Bitcoin’s recent rollercoaster ride of an investment strategy. 
  
  Qamar ends his series of points poignantly, referencing a financial critique Bitcoin had been struggling to deal with: high transaction fees for slow transactions. In order to effectively use cryptocurrency as a currency, “money” needs to move hands often. High transaction fees discourage users from making transactions, and the slow transaction times make it harder for Bitcoin to be used in day to day sales – people want some assurance that they will get their money. Monero, on the other hand, has significantly faster transaction times and much lower fees (Qamar, 2018). This means, cryptocurrency enthusiasts who switch to Monero can actually use it! They may even make a hefty profit while doing so. 
  
  The ending of Qamar’s post is intended as a qualifying closer. He ties up his argument in a few words: “Monero is superior” (Qamar, 2018) and adds in a simple reference to timing. He relates the reader right at the end, pointing out that this is simply how he feels, and in doing so sets up the following pressure point. Qamar points out that adoption of crypto is at its peak, and now is the time to act. A small, but almost friendly, push towards his side of things leaves the reader with a lingering feeling that maybe he is right, maybe Monero truly is the next best thing.

### Project 2 - Revised

See pdf [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dermers/dermers.github.io/blob/master/adv_writ/Project2.pdf). *Note: not included directly to allow for convenient formatting*

### My First Piece

*I wanted to use the first writing exercise as one of my artifacts as a chance to see just how far I've come in the class. Going all the way back to beginning provided the perfect opportunity to analyze the styles and skills I came into the class with and compare those with how I've been writing as the semester comes to an end.*

When I was much younger, in preschool, I was quite the trouble-maker. Easily bored, I made a game of everything, so when my preschool teachers announced a “water fight” I was excited to have the chance to actually spend my pent up energy.  

The day came, I was ready in my bathing suit, towel hung up by the door like the rest of my classmates, and already planning where I would make my “fort”. My best friend (whose name I can never remember) and I ran straight underneath the playground and behind one of the climbing walls as the teachers attempted to get everyone soaked with water hoses. Us kids were squealing, running, and all around having a blast.  

My friend and I, however, were satisfied with our hiding spot and thought we had “won”, determined to stay dry no matter what. After all, they hadn’t even attempted to spray us for quite awhile. After what felt like a much longer recess (because it was - oops) we figured we must be the driest kids out there, it was awesome. I peeked around the corner, confused as to why the screaming and hoses stopped only to find our teachers, in a panic holding my towel. For them, there was an extra towel and thus a missing kid. I hadn’t run away; I was still on the playground, so it hadn’t occurred to me that maybe my hiding spot was too good.  

In the end, I realized my mistake, ran out to get my towel and got a stern talking to about “listening to the teachers” when I need to come back inside. Of course, my mom wouldn’t let me live it down, and the story has since spread around my family like wildfire.  

I think this story came to mind primarily for two reasons. First, this is a lighthearted, silly family story about me. In a small, discussion based class I felt there would be a unique benefit to sharing something in my life, for the sake of allowing my fellow classmates to better get to know me. Second, last semester, I had to pair up with another student and provide a spoken introduction of said partner. One such question we asked each other was for a family story. My partner went first, and shared a vaguely similar story of preschool embarrassment.  Such a story reminded me of my own, and this prompt reminded me of the aforementioned assignment from last semester and thus the story itself.

### Car Accident Exercise

*While not very long, the exercise where we had to explain a car accident to three different audiences is a great example of what I feel I learned in this course. While I think I have had decent writing skills for a few years now, this course really allowed me to develop the ability to tailor those skills towards a specific audience with a specific goal in mind. When I join my field and write to a Computer Science audience, I have to be able to adopt styles, tones, and formatting that I have not had as much practice in as traditional writing.*

To Parents: “I got in an accident. Everyone’s ok. I haven’t said anything. The police etc. are on their way, I’ll wait for you.”  
To Friends: “Welp, I hit a car”  
To Insurance: “It was raining with low visibility and I was in a minor collision. I have not claimed responsibility. What do we need to do?”
